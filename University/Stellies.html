        <h6>Stellenbosch University(SU) is firmly committed to the pursuit of knowledge, research and innovation, in service of society. We provide a world-class centre for learning and development, which is globally relevant, yet rooted in the upliftment and transformation of our local communities. Our actions are guided by key values and attributes, and enabled by outstanding staff and students, sound operating systems and a deep sense of purpose. SU is home to an academic community of more than 32 500 students, including more than 3 700 international students from 104 countries. SU has 4 658 permanent and fixed-term contract staff members, including 1 393 academics.​

            Our ten faculties (AgriSciences, Arts and Social Sciences, Economic and Management Sciences, Education, Engineering, Law, Medicine and Health Sciences, Military Science, Science, and Theology) as well as the School for Climate Studies, the School for Data Science and Computational Thinking and the Stellenbosch Business School are located across five campuses in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
            
            
            According to official figures of the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) released in 2022, SU is among South Africa’s top three research-intensive universities, both per capita and in terms of total research output. 
            
            SU now boast a total of 20 of A-rated researchers – our highest number to date – having received nine new A-ratings in the 2021 rating round.
            
            We host 44 research chairs – 23 as part of the DSI-NRF SARChI programme and 21 endowed or industry-funded chairs. In 2012, that number was 16. Research chairs make a very significant contribution to the research outputs, impact and income of SU as a thriving research-intensive institution. 
            
            The number of postdoctoral fellows has grown from 154 in 2012 to more than 340 registered postdoctoral research fellows registered at SU in 2022.</h6>
