        <p class="intro">Scholarships and bursaries are forms of financial assistance provided to students to help them cover the costs of education. They are often offered by educational institutions, governments, private organizations, foundations, and individuals. While both scholarships and bursaries aim to support students financially, there are some differences between the two terms:

            Scholarships:
            Scholarships are typically awarded based on merit, which can include academic achievements, leadership qualities, extracurricular activities, community service, artistic talents, and more. They are often competitive and require applicants to meet specific criteria set by the scholarship provider. Scholarships can be provided by universities, colleges, private companies, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. Recipients of scholarships usually need to maintain a certain level of performance or engagement to continue receiving the financial aid.
            
            Bursaries:
            Bursaries are usually awarded based on financial need. They are intended to help students who may face financial barriers to accessing education. Bursaries take into account factors like family income, personal circumstances, and other financial challenges. Unlike scholarships, which may require specific accomplishments or talents, bursaries focus primarily on the financial situation of the applicant. They are often provided by universities, colleges, and various organizations that want to support students from lower-income backgrounds.</p>
