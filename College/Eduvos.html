        <p class="intro">The word Eduvos comes from the concept of your education. The “Edu” part of Eduvos talks about education and taking custodianship and responsibility. The “Vos” part of Eduvos talks about you, yourself, and your best self. The combination of Edu and Vos talks about taking responsibility for your education and making the best choice for yourself. Your education is your future.

            Eduvos has a long history that started in 1979 with the founding of the Computer Technology Institute (CTI) that was later merged with Midrand Graduate Institute (MGI) and operated for some years as Pearson Institute of Higher Education (PIHE). The new name of the institution was the result of a change of ownership and a new focus on high quality, blended learning across Africa.

            An education is one of the most important investments to raise socio-economic status and long-term earnings potential of an individual. It is also the gateway to having the skills to create change, organise and to operate in specific industries.

            Eduvos is the institution of choice for students that are seeking to prepare themselves for a future career through a great learning experience.
